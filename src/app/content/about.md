## Mission Overview

Project Kororā is Victoria University of Wellington's first student-run space mission, aiming to design, build, and propose a CubeSat equipped with a novel miniature Hall-effect thruster. We are a multidisciplinary team of undergraduate and postgraduate students working across science, engineering, and design, collaborating to develop both advanced propulsion technology and strong documentation for future missions.

The project addresses two major gaps: First, it responds to the lack of effective propulsion in CubeSat missions, which typically restricts them to a single orbital configuration. Our focus is the design of a Hall-effect thruster capable of operating within the size, power, and thermal constraints of a 3U CubeSat. Second, the project aims to build capacity in New Zealand's growing new space sector by enabling students to work directly with leading researchers and organisations in the field. We are working alongside the Robinson Research Institute and plan to actively engage with Rocket Lab and other industry partners.

Project Kororā is more than just an engineering challenge. It is a systems-level initiative involving orbital mechanics, software, thermal and power systems, mechanical design, radio communications, design, ethics, and policy. The goal for 2025 is to produce a complete, NZSA-compliant mission proposal that can serve as a national demonstration of student-led space capability.

## Our Name

Our project name comes from the little blue penguin, or kororā, Aotearoa New Zealand's smallest native penguin. Like its namesake, our satellite is compact but ambitious. With this mission, we hope to help shape the future of student space exploration in Aotearoa and contribute meaningfully to New Zealand's high-growth aerospace sector.

## Project Objectives for 2025

- Deliver a detailed, NZSA-compliant proposal.
- Form active subteams with clear goals, timelines, and documentation practices.
- Launch a mock version of the CubeSat via weather balloon to test communications, telemetry, and integration under near-space conditions.
- Build relationships with industry, academic experts, and other CubeSat teams internationally.
- Contribute to the long-term development of an accessible, open-source CubeSat platform for future student missions.
