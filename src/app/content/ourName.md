## Our Name

Our project name comes from the little blue penguin, or kororƒÅ, Aotearoa New Zealand's smallest native penguin. Like its namesake, our satellite is compact but ambitious. With this mission, we hope to help shape the future of student space exploration in Aotearoa and contribute meaningfully to New Zealand's high-growth aerospace sector.

## Project Objectives for 2025

- Deliver a detailed, NZSA-compliant proposal.
- Form active subteams with clear goals, timelines, and documentation practices.
- Launch a mock version of the CubeSat via weather balloon to test communications, telemetry, and integration under near-space conditions.
- Build relationships with industry, academic experts, and other CubeSat teams internationally.
- Contribute to the long-term development of an accessible, open-source CubeSat platform for future student missions.
