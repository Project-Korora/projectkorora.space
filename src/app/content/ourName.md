## Our Name

Our name comes from the little blue penguin, or kororā—Aotearoa New Zealand’s smallest native penguin. Like its namesake, our satellite is compact but ambitious. With this mission, we hope to inspire a new generation of students and contribute to New Zealand's high-growth aerospace sector.

## Project Objectives for 2025

- Foster a network of space enthusiast students at Victoria University and across Aotearoa.
- Build visibility for the project.
- Raise 500 - 1k in funding for the project.
- Build relationships with industry, academic experts, and other CubeSat teams internationally.
- Deliver a detailed final iteration of a NZSA-compliant proposal by the end of the year.
- Maintain active subteams with clear goals, timelines, and documentation practices.
- Launch a made version of the cubesat via weather balloon to test the communications
- Contribute to the long-term development of an accessible, open-source CubeSat platform for future student missions.

Project Kororā brings together ambition, technical rigour, and community-driven design to push the boundaries of what students can achieve in space.
