## Mission Overview

Project Kororā is Victoria University of Wellington's first student-run space mission, aiming to design, build, and propose a CubeSat equipped with a novel miniature Hall-effect thruster. We are a multidisciplinary team of undergraduate and postgraduate students working across science, engineering, and design, collaborating to develop both advanced propulsion technology and strong documentation for future missions.

The project addresses two major gaps: First, it responds to the lack of effective propulsion in CubeSat missions, which typically restricts them to a single orbital configuration. Our focus is the design of a Hall-effect thruster capable of operating within the size, power, and thermal constraints of a 3U CubeSat. Second, the project aims to build capacity in New Zealand's growing new space sector by enabling students to work directly with leading researchers and organisations in the field. We are working alongside the Robinson Research Institute and plan to actively engage with Rocket Lab and other industry partners.

Project Kororā is more than just an engineering challenge. It is a systems-level initiative involving orbital mechanics, software, thermal and power systems, mechanical design, radio communications, design, ethics, and policy. The goal for 2025 is to produce a complete, NZSA-compliant mission proposal that can serve as a national demonstration of student-led space capability.
