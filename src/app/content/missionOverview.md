## Mission Overview

Project Kororā is Victoria University of Wellington’s first student-run space mission. We aim to foster and build a community of space enthusiast students through the development of a 3U CubeSat project. We want to create an ecosystem where students from all backgrounds can explore their interest in space. We currently have over 100+ students across a multidisciplinary background, from STEM, law, design, and the arts.

Our project fosters hands-on learning, peer mentorship, and collaborative upskilling. Through workshops, and open-source platforms, we aim to lower the barrier to entry for anyone curious about space technology. By working towards the development of a satellite, our team members are building tangible, industry-relevant skills: how to simulate orbits, write embedded software, design mechanical frames, plan ground communication, assess legal risk, and much more. We see Project Kororā not just as a space mission, but as a training ground for New Zealand’s future space workforce.

Our long-term goal is to design, build, and propose a 3U CubeSat equipped with a novel miniature Hall-effect thruster, developed to operate within the size, power, and thermal constraints of a 3U CubeSat. We work alongside researchers at the Robinson Research Institute and plan to engage closely with Rocket Lab and other national and international partners.
