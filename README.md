The official website for Project KororƒÅ, a student-led space initiative at Te Herenga Waka‚ÄîVictoria University of Wellington, focused on developing New Zealand's space economy through CubeSat development.

### Getting Started

There are two ways to set up the project locally: using Docker (recommended) or traditional setup.

#### Option 1: Docker Setup (Recommended)

Prerequisites:

- Docker installed ([Get Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/))
- Docker Compose installed (comes with Docker Desktop)

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Project-Korora/projectkorora.space.git
   cd projectkorora.space
   ```

2. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   # For development (with hot reload)
   docker compose up web

   # For production build
   docker compose up web-prod
   ```

3. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

Note for Apple Silicon (M1/M2) users:

- Uncomment the `platform: linux/amd64` line in `docker-compose.yml` if you experience any issues.

#### Option 2: Traditional Setup

Prerequisites:

- Git installed (https://git-scm.com/)
- Node.js and npm installed (https://nodejs.org/)

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Project-Korora/projectkorora.space.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the website's directory:

   ```bash
   cd projectkorora.space
   ```

3. Install the dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Run the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
